# Currency Exchange - Alex Tan

This is a project that I did in my spare time to practice using Sass and Angularjs.

## 1. How to Run
Upon downloading these files/repository, open the main folder.<br>
Inside the folder, open the index.html with any web browser.<br>

## 2. How to use
Enter the amount you wish to convert.<br>
Select the currency your are changing from and the currency you are converting to.<br>
The selection is based off the first and last 3 characters.<br>
ex: USDEUR would convert from USD to EUR.<br>
Click the convert button to convert.
The right side will change to complete the conversion and change based off the rate at that time.<br>

## 3. Attribution
All currency information was taken from the [Forex API](https://1forge.com/forex-data-api).
